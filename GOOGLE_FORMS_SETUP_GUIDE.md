};
```

## üåê **Step 4: Website Integration Options**

### **Option A: Direct Redirect (Recommended)**
Replace your form submission with a redirect to Google Forms:

```javascript
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  // Get form data
  const formData = new FormData(e.target);
  
  // Redirect to Google Form with pre-filled data
  const baseUrl = 'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/YOUR_FORM_ID/viewform';
  const params = new URLSearchParams({
    'entry.123456789': formData.get('fullName'),
    'entry.987654321': formData.get('email'),
    'entry.456789123': formData.get('phone'),
    // Add other fields...
  });
  
  window.open(`${baseUrl}?${params.toString()}`, '_blank');
};
```

### **Option B: Embed Form (Full Integration)**
Replace your entire form section with an embedded Google Form:

```jsx
<div className="w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto">
  <iframe 
    src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/YOUR_FORM_ID/viewform?embedded=true" 
    width="100%" 
    height="1200"
    frameBorder="0"
    marginHeight="0" 
    marginWidth="0"
    className="rounded-lg shadow-lg"
  >
    Loading Google Form...
  </iframe>
</div>
```

### **Option C: Hybrid Approach (Best UX)**
Keep your beautiful form design, submit to Google Forms in background:

```javascript
const submitToGoogleForms = async (formData) => {
  const formURL = 'https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/e/YOUR_FORM_ID/formResponse';
  
  const data = new FormData();
  data.append('entry.123456789', formData.fullName);
  data.append('entry.987654321', formData.email);
  // Add other fields...
  
  try {
    await fetch(formURL, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: data,
      mode: 'no-cors'
    });
    
    // Show success message
    alert('‚úÖ Application submitted successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Submission error:', error);
    // Fallback to direct form URL
    window.open('https://forms.gle/YOUR_FORM_ID', '_blank');
  }
};
```
