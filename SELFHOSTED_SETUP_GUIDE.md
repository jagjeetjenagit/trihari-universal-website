## ðŸš€ **Setup Instructions (10 Minutes)**

### Step 1: Get Web Hosting

You need a web hosting service that supports PHP. Great options:

**Budget Options ($3-10/month):**
- Hostinger
- Namecheap
- Bluehost
- SiteGround

**All include:**
- âœ… PHP support
- âœ… Email functionality
- âœ… File upload capabilities
- âœ… cPanel/control panel

### Step 2: Upload Backend Files

1. **Connect to your hosting** (via cPanel File Manager or FTP)
2. **Create folder structure:**
   ```
   your-domain.com/
   â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ audition_handler.php
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .htaccess
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ uploads/auditions/ (will be created automatically)
   ```

3. **Upload the files** I created:
   - `backend/audition_handler.php`
   - `backend/.htaccess`

### Step 3: Configure the PHP Script

Edit `audition_handler.php` and update these settings:

```php
// Line 19: Replace with your email
$ADMIN_EMAIL = 'your-actual-email@gmail.com';

// Line 20: Update your company name
$WEBSITE_NAME = 'Trihari Universal';
```

### Step 4: Update Your Website Code

In your `TrihariUniversalSimple.jsx`, find line with the fetch URL and replace:

```javascript
// Replace 'your-domain.com' with your actual domain
const response = await fetch('https://your-actual-domain.com/backend/audition_handler.php', {
```

**Example:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://trihariuniversal.com/backend/audition_handler.php', {
```

### Step 5: Test Your Setup

1. **Upload your changes**
2. **Visit your website**
3. **Fill out the audition form**
4. **Submit and check:**
   - âœ… You receive an email notification
   - âœ… Applicant gets confirmation email
   - âœ… Data is saved to `audition_applications.csv`
   - âœ… Files uploaded to `uploads/auditions/`

## ðŸ“§ **Email Configuration**

Most hosting providers have email pre-configured. If emails aren't working:

1. **Check your hosting email settings**
2. **Verify your domain email is set up**
3. **Add this to the PHP script** if needed:

```php
// Advanced email configuration (if needed)
ini_set('SMTP', 'your-smtp-server.com');
ini_set('smtp_port', '587');
ini_set('sendmail_from', 'noreply@yourdomain.com');
```

## ðŸ“Š **Data Management**
