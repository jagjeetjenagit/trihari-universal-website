# Alternative Method to Find File Upload Entry ID

## Method 1: Create a Test Submission

### Step 1: Test Your Current Form
1. Go to your Google Form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfx1uyXj0I5oE0Dn7Elmve4VJ3i5hRDjcPA2FG54nknzTCKXQ/viewform

2. **Check if the file upload field exists:**
   - Scroll through all 11 questions
   - Look for a question that says "Headshot or Resume"
   - It should have a file upload button/area

3. **If you DON'T see a file upload field:**
   - Your Google Form might not have Question 11 (file upload) added yet
   - You need to add it manually

### Step 2: Add File Upload Field (if missing)
If the file upload field is missing:

1. **Edit your Google Form:**
   - Go to: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FAIpQLSfx1uyXj0I5oE0Dn7Elmve4VJ3i5hRDjcPA2FG54nknzTCKXQ/edit

2. **Add Question 11:**
   - Click the "+" button to add a new question
   - Change question type to "File upload"
   - Question title: "Headshot or Resume"
   - Description: "Upload your headshot or acting resume (Max 10MB, JPG/PNG/PDF)"
   - Settings: Allow Images (JPG, PNG, GIF) and PDFs
   - Max file size: 10 MB
   - Max files: 1

3. **Save the form**

### Step 3: Find Entry ID Using Network Tab
1. **Open your form** in browser
2. **Open Developer Tools** (F12)
3. **Go to Network tab**
4. **Fill out the form completely** with test data
5. **Select a small image file** for upload
6. **Submit the form**
7. **Look in Network tab** for a request to Google Forms
8. **Check the request payload** - you'll see all entry IDs including file upload

## Method 2: Use a Test Tool

Let me create a simple test to check what entry IDs are actually available:

### Quick Test:
1. Fill out your form with test data
2. Try to submit it 
3. Check the browser's Network tab during submission
4. Look for the actual entry IDs being sent

## Method 3: Manual Trial and Error

Since you have 10 entry IDs and your form should have 11 questions, the file upload entry ID might be one that's missing from your list.

**Your current IDs:**
- entry.470858559
- entry.1574003417  
- entry.1394621864
- entry.163869454
- entry.1222485795
- entry.1667748542
- entry.808555411
- entry.736087672
- entry.825280997
- entry.2037686470

**Common file upload entry ID patterns:**
- Usually a different number pattern
- Often higher or lower than the regular field IDs

## Method 4: Simplify - Skip File Upload for Now

If you can't find the file upload entry ID, we can:

1. **Make file upload optional** in your website form
2. **Test the form** with just the 10 fields we have
3. **Add file upload later** once we get the entry ID

Would you like me to:
1. **Help you add the file upload field** to your Google Form?
2. **Test the current setup** without file upload?
3. **Create a simpler version** for now?
