# Debug Google Forms Submission - Step by Step

## Current Status:
✅ Form submits without errors  
❌ Data not appearing in Google Forms responses

## Most Common Causes:

### 1. Entry IDs Don't Match Your Actual Form
The entry IDs you provided might not match your Google Form structure.

### 2. Form URL Issue
Your form might be using a different URL format.

### 3. Form Structure Mismatch
Your Google Form might have different questions than expected.

## Debug Steps:

### Step 1: Verify Your Google Form Structure
1. **Go to your Google Form EDIT page:**
   https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FAIpQLSfx1uyXj0I5oE0Dn7Elmve4VJ3i5hRDjcPA2FG54nknzTCKXQ/edit

2. **Count your questions:**
   - How many questions do you actually have?
   - What are the exact question titles?

### Step 2: Test Your Google Form Manually
1. **Go to your form VIEW page:**
   https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfx1uyXj0I5oE0Dn7Elmve4VJ3i5hRDjcPA2FG54nknzTCKXQ/viewform

2. **Fill it out manually** with test data
3. **Submit it**
4. **Check if it appears in responses**

If manual submission doesn't work, there's an issue with your Google Form itself.

### Step 3: Get Fresh Entry IDs
Your entry IDs might be wrong. Let's get them again:

1. **Go to your form:** (view mode)
2. **Open browser DevTools** (F12)
3. **Go to Console tab**
4. **Run this JavaScript:**
```javascript
Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('input, select, textarea')).map(el => ({
  name: el.name,
  type: el.type,
  question: el.closest('[data-question-index]')?.querySelector('[data-question-label]')?.textContent || 'Unknown'
})).filter(item => item.name && item.name.includes('entry.')).forEach(item => console.log(item))
```

This will show you all entry IDs with their corresponding questions.

### Step 4: Check Form URL Format
Try changing the form URL format in your code:

**Current:**
```
https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/e/1FAIpQLSfx1uyXj0I5oE0Dn7Elmve4VJ3i5hRDjcPA2FG54nknzTCKXQ/formResponse
```

**Alternative formats to try:**
```
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfx1uyXj0I5oE0Dn7Elmve4VJ3i5hRDjcPA2FG54nknzTCKXQ/formResponse
```

### Step 5: Enable CORS Mode (Temporary Test)
Let's test with CORS enabled to see if we get any error messages:

Change the fetch mode from `no-cors` to `cors` temporarily to see what error we get.

## Quick Questions:
1. **When you go to your Google Form edit page, how many questions do you see?**
2. **What are the exact titles of questions 1-5?**
3. **Do you see responses when you manually submit the form?**

Let me know the answers and I'll help you fix this!
