5. Date of Birth
6. Gender
7. Experience Level
8. Primary Skills

## Next Steps:
1. Get the complete pre-filled URL with ALL fields filled
2. Send me the full URL
3. I'll extract all entry IDs and update your code

OR

If you want to do it yourself:
1. From the pre-filled URL, identify which entry ID corresponds to which field
2. Let me know the mapping (e.g., "entry.123456789 = Full Name")
3. I'll update your code accordingly
