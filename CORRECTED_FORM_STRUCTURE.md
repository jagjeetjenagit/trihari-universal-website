# Updated Form Structure - NO File Upload Field

## Corrected Understanding:
❌ **Previous assumption**: Question 11 is file upload  
✅ **Reality**: Question 11 is consent (multiple choice with one option)

## Your Google Form Structure:
1. Question 1: Full Name (text) → `entry.470858559`
2. Question 2: City (text) → `entry.1574003417`
3. Question 3: Email (text) → `entry.1394621864`
4. Question 4: Phone (text) → `entry.163869454`
5. Question 5: Date of Birth (date) → `entry.1222485795`
6. Question 6: Gender (multiple choice) → `entry.1667748542`
7. Question 7: Experience (multiple choice) → `entry.808555411`
8. Question 8: Skills (text) → `entry.736087672`
9. Question 9: Instagram (text) → `entry.825280997`
10. Question 10: Portfolio (text) → `entry.2037686470`
11. **Question 11: Consent (multiple choice)** → **❌ MISSING ENTRY ID**

## What We Need:
- **Find the entry ID for Question 11 (consent field)**
- **Remove file upload functionality** (since your Google Form doesn't support it)

## To Find Entry ID for Question 11:
1. **Go to your Google Form**
2. **Right-click on the consent checkbox/radio button**
3. **Inspect Element**
4. **Look for**: `name="entry.XXXXXXXXX"` on the consent input field

## Quick Test:
Try the **pre-filled link method**:
1. Go to your Google Form edit page
2. Click ⋮ → "Get pre-filled link"
3. Fill ALL 11 fields (including checking the consent box)
4. Get the link - it will show ALL 11 entry IDs including consent

The consent entry ID is the one missing from your current list of 10.
